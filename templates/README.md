# regular.express

[regular.express](http://regular.express) is static website powered by Github Pages.

We use special library **[Jikji](https://github.com/Prev/jikji/tree/0.5)** to automate rendering pages. Datas are stored in [Cloudant](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloudant), which is document database service powered by IBM.



## Build manually

Originally, this website is built automatically for every hour by Jenkins. But now it stopped by cost problem.

However, you can build this website manually with terminal and `git`


### How to build & test service

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rexpress/web-res
$ cd web-res
$ pip install -r requirements.txt # or use pip3
$ python -m jikji . listen # or use python3
```

Then you can see website in `http://localhost:7000`
